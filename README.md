# Script to make root cause analysis

## How to use it
Python 3 script over _Pandas_ to identify which are the variables that most explain a change in a metric.

Need to define, main metric, variables of before and after, categoric variables and the numeric variables.

The main idea behind is that a step in the funnel or some group is the cause of a result, excluding that step or that group the result has to be opposite
